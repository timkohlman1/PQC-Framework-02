# Framework Architecture

## Purpose

This document describes the planned architecture of the PQC IoT experiment framework.

## Planned Layers

The framework is expected to cover:

1. firmware builds
2. remote flashing
3. UART and log capture
4. result manifests
5. boot-security variants
6. MQTT transport variants
7. TLS/classical crypto variants
8. PQC/hybrid crypto variants
9. network degradation profiles
10. benchmark aggregation and analysis

## Current Status

The repository contains the known-good STM32 HAL baseline firmware project.

The first minimal framework skeleton now exists.
